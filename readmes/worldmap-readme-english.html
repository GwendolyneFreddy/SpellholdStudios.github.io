		<h2>Introduction</h2><br>

		<p>
			This mod replaces the ingame worldmap with a large, new worldmap. It is used especially for the Megamodification (BGT, TDD, SOS, CtB, TS, DSotSC, NTotSC, SoBH, Drizzt Saga...) or partial installations of the Megamodification. It also includes a full set of coloured map icons.
		</p>
		<p>
			The mod offers the choice between two different worldmap sizes: large and huge. Either of these two worldmaps can be used for BG1, BG2 and ToB. Alternatively, a smaller, specially prepared worldmap can be used for ToB.
		</p>
		<p>
			The mod also offers optional, alternative travel times and area visibility.
		</p>
		<p>
			Lastly, the mod includes a savegame converter, which allows old saved games to be updated to include the new map(s). (The worldmap data is also stored in the savegame files. If you want to install this worldmap, run the savegame converter and you don't have to start a new game.)
		</p><br>
		<p>
			This is the original introduction written by Yacomo:
		</p>

		<div class="important">
  		<p>
			Please allow me a few words about my motivation in doing this...
		</p>
		<p>
			I always loved maps, guess since I first got my hands on the middle earth atlas. I always liked the infinity engine games as well, but those two things had nothing to do with each other...
		</p>

		<p>
			Well, nothing to do until I started playing the BP-BGT-NeJ-CtB-DSotSC-BH-NTotSC monster in early 2005. I became a fan of the Check the Bodies worldmap immediately and I fell in love with the spirit of the modding community shortly thereafter. I had to give it back something...
		</p>

		<p>
			What I never liked about the BP&ndash;BGT map was the mix of coloured and black and white icons. So I was already tinkering with the idea of creating coloured versions of all the Baldur's Gate map icons when Horred the Plague posted <a class="inter-link" href="http://forums.spellholdstudios.net/index.php?act=ST&amp;f=193&amp;t=13954">link</a> on the former forgottenwars forums...
		</p>

  		<p>
			That was the starter I was waiting for! So I picked up the task, made myself comfortable with GIMP (who needs Photoshop - bah :-) and this is the result - hope ya like it!
		</p>
		</div>

		<p>
			At the beginning of the year 2006 Yacomo retired the first time from this mod and King Diamond and Weigo took over the worldmap. King Diamond, one of the WeiDU coding chiefs, made a fantastic new code for the worldmap. Weigo made a lot of small and large changes to the worldmaps.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the spring of 2007 Erebusant made an extra update for alternative travel times, area visibility and he took over the support in the forum and is still helping to find all bugs and testing new codes.
		</p>
		<p>
			One and a half year later Yacomo returned and he brought a new larger worldmap. With Weigo's help, the map is now completely labeled with all cities, mountains and regions.

		<h2>Compatibility</h2><br>

		<p>
			This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The series of Enhanced Editions published by Beamdog, which at present includes Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (BGEE) and Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE). The BGEE Siege of Dragonspear expansion (SoD) is supported as well.</li>
			<li>The original Baldur's Gate II with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion. <strong>Make sure you have Throne of Bhaal patched to version 26498.</strong> Check the ReadMe files related to your patch in your game folder and the <a href="http://www.bioware.com/games/throne_bhaal/support/patches/">BioWare</a> website if necessary.</li>
			<li>The conversion projects based on <acronym title="Throne of Bhaal">ToB</acronym>, <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu/"><strong>Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</strong></a>, <a href="https://www.pocketplane.net/bg1tutu/"><strong>Baldur's Gate Tutu</strong></a> and <a href="https://github.com/K4thos/EET/releases"><strong>Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)</strong></a>.</li>
		</ul><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<p>
			BP&ndash;BGT Worldmap is a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. However, we cannot test every single one. If you encounter any bugs, please report them on the forum!
		</p>
		<p>
			&#9888;&#65039; Though we are striving to make Worldmap compatible with as many other mods as possible, there is always a chance that incompatibilities will arise. Below are the ones discovered thus far:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>BP&ndash;BGT Worldmap is not compatible with any Baldurdash!!!</strong></li>
		</ul><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<p>
			Although it is not required for this mod to function properly, you are strongly recommended to also download and install the <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.

		<h2>Installation</h2><br>

		<h3>Notes</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			<em>If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-bp-bgt-worldmap.exe&nbsp;</span></strong>, un-install all previously installed components and delete the &#x1F4C1; bp-bgt-worldmap folder.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>When installing or un-installing, <strong>do not close the <acronym title="Disk Operating System">DOS</acronym> window</strong> by clicking on the <strong>X</strong> button! Instead, press the <strong>Enter</strong> key whenever instructed to do so.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Disable any antivirus</strong> or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can extract files from the archive using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, <a href="http://www.zipgenius.it/ita/?page_id=12">ZipGenius</a> or another file compression utility that handles .zip files.
		</p><br>

		<p>
			BP&ndash;BGT Worldmap relies on an external executable called <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/topic/47779-mospack/">mosunpack</a>. Mosunpack comes bundled with the mod (located in bp-bgt-worldmap/bin/) and the mod will attempt to run it inside the mod directory. Should this for any reason not be possible, you need to place mosunpack on your system path and allow it to be executed as a program (chmod it) before attempting to install the mod.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Special Note for Siege of Dragonspear from Steam/GOG</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			Good Old Games (GOG) and Steam both package the additional content for Siege of Dragonspear in a method that <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>, the tool used to install this mod, cannot access. You must run a program called <a href="https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger/releases/latest">DLC Merger</a> on your SoD installation before you can install this or any other WeiDU-based mod.
		</p></br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Enhanced Editions Note</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.
		</p></br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Windows</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			BP&ndash;BGT Worldmap for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify (<em>the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file</em>). On successful extraction, there should be a &#x1F4C1; bp-bgt-worldmap folder and a setup-bp-bgt-worldmap.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-bp-bgt-worldmap.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the installer itself is finished, the map graphics will be uncompressed automatically. This last step may take a while depending on your machine. Please do not interrupt it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-bp-bgt-worldmap.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change components.
		</p></br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Mac OS X</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			BP&ndash;BGT Worldmap for EE for Mac OS X is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a &#x1F4C1; bp-bgt-worldmap folder, setup-bp-bgt-worldmap and setup-bp-bgt-worldmap.command files in your game folder. To install, double-click <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-bp-bgt-worldmap.command&nbsp;</span></strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
		</p>
		<p>
			You can run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-bp-bgt-worldmap.command&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise the components settings.
		</p></br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Linux</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			BP&ndash;BGT Worldmap for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> installer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.
		</p>
		<p>
			Download the latest Linux version of <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases"><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym></a> and copy weidu and weinstall to /usr/bin. Then open a terminal and <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;cd&nbsp;</span></strong> to your game installation directory.
		</p>
		<p>
			<em>Optional: run 'tolower' and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either, if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.</em>
		</p>
		<p>
			Run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;weinstall setup-bp-bgt-worldmap&nbsp;</span></strong> in your game folder to install the mod. Then run <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;wine bgmain.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> (or <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;wine baldur.exe&nbsp;</span></strong> for EE games), and start playing.
		</p><br>


		<hr style="width: 90%;"/><br>


		<h3>Note for Complete Un-installation</h3>

		<p style="margin-top:2%;">
			In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using <strong><span class="weidu">&nbsp;setup-bp-bgt-worldmap --uninstall&nbsp;</span></strong> at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.
		</p>
		<p>
			&#9888;&#65039; If you un-install the mod and you wish to keep using your existing saved-games, you need to run the savegame converter <em>after</em> the un-installation.

				<li style="margin-left:-4%; margin-right:-8%;">Moved Amkethran to the hills on the outskirts of the Calim desert, so it's in reasonable proximity of Abazigal's Lair and Sendai's Enclave and somewhere you could conceivably end up at after leaving the Oasis.</li>

				<li style="margin-left:-4%; margin-right:-8%;">Moved the North Forest north and east, so it's not an unbelievable detour on the path to the Temple.</li>
				<li style="margin-left:-4%; margin-right:-8%;">Swapped the locations of Abazigal's Lair and Sendai's Enclave, so their local maps better match the terrain on the worldmap.</li>

		  </ul><br>


      <h6>Version 4 &nbsp;(November 4, 2005)</h6>

			<li>Upgraded installer to WeiDU 185.</li>

		  </ul><br>

			<li>Added missing map link that made it impossible to reach Eshpurta in the TDD part of the game.</li>
			<li>Added compatibility to &quot;old&quot; BGT without the CtB compatibility fix from Sir BillyBob; two BGT areas (AR3500 and AR3600) were renamed starting with DSotSC since they were also used in CtB.</li>
			<li>Fixed a serious bug introduced in v2 concerning the visibility flag for Irenicus Dungeon (AR0602); that bug that made it effectively impossible to enter Waukeen's Promenade (AR0700) via the map, you had to clua there. &#128577;</li>
			<li>Updated to mosunpack 0.92.</li>
			<li>Updated installer so that it is not possible to install optional mod components without installing the main worldmap first.</li>
		  </ul><br>

			<li>Added modified start scripts for NearInfinity so that you can use it to edit save games using the new map.</li>

			<li>Fixed area links for AR3300 (where you rescue the cow from the Xvarts), at least one of them could cause a crash to desktop; thanks to Sir BillyBob for pointing this out.</li>
			<li>Fixed bug where Watcher's Keep would appear twice if Check the Bodies was not installed, thanks to King Diamond for pointing this out.</li>
			<li>Moved Trollford to the west of Umar Hills, thanks to Chevalier for pointing this out.</li>
			<li>Moved Suldanessellar to the immediate south of Forest of Tethir and moved both closer to Underdark Exit, thanks to Chevalier for pointing this out.</li>
			<li>Reorganized installer, so that a normal player can just say &quot;install all&quot; and get what he expects instead of some strange debug install.</li>
		  </ul><br>


		<h6>Version 1 &nbsp;(March 10, 2005)</h6>

		  <ul>

			<li>Changed Rauthym Island to use the unused sequence 82.</li>
			<li>Completely rebuilt bpbgtmap.bam, eliminating any unused or duplicated frames, the amount of frames was reduced from 3007 to 1144 this way - the file is now usable again in BAMWorkshop II. &#128521;</li>
			<li>Compressed bpbgtmap.bam using DLTCEP, this together with the rebuild reduced file size from 9022kb to 1679kb - partly compensates for the giant worldmap.mos that I introduced.</li>
			<li>Updated the worldmap.wmp file from Bonehill 1.8 for the new map size.</li>
