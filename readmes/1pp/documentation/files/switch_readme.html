			This component allows armour and robes to properly show up for characters of any class when equipped. While normally robes would not show up for fighter/cleric/thief animations, and armour would not show up for mage animations, this is circumvented by changing the character animation accordingly while such items are equipped.<br><br>

		<h2>Additional Information</h2><br>

		<h4>1ppv4: Improved Improved Galactygon's Avatar Switching</h4><br>

		<p>
			<strong>Like the name suggests, this is an improved version of my original improved version of <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/user/1494-galactygon/">Galactygon</a>'s avatar appearance tweak (to be found in the BGII Tweakpack).</strong><br><br>

			Basically, what this does is it dynamically changes character animations to fit equipped armour (and then dynamically changes it back when unequipped!). While normally robes would not show up for fighter/cleric/thief animations, and armour would not show up for mage animations, this is circumvented by changing the character animation accordingly while such items are equipped.<br><br>
			If you were using the BGII Tweakpack component, it should be uninstalled before installing this. The component is designed to work with the restored thief avatar series, so it is not recommended as a standalone install.<br><br>
			Due to the properly working thief animations, this foregoes a lot of the scripting my old fix relied upon, while offering superior content.<br>
		</p><br>

		<h4>1ppv4: IWD Avatar Switching</h4><br>

		<p>
			<strong>This is an IWD HoW/TotL port of the avatar switching component. As far as I am aware this is the first mod that does this.</strong><br><br>

			Due to IWD's game engine, some parts have to be implemented differently. While the HoW engine supports .EFF files, it does not allow them to trigger spells. Neither can spells directly be linked to an item, because regardless of any parameters they seem to fire continuously (when you'd only want them to do so once). To make matters worse IWD has no main script that is constantly evaluated.<br><br>
			This implementation works around those issues by switching manually through item/innate abilities.<br><br>
			When you equip an item, your avatar will not switch automatically. Instead the item will give you an item ability (click on Item Abilities in the quickbar). If it's necessary to change character appearance (e.g. by equipping robes on a fighter), use this item ability to switch.<br><br>
			As soon as you have done this, an innate ability will appear that resets your character to their base type. The innate will stay available indefinitely until it is used or another armour is equipped and changed into. You can change into and out of the same armour as you desire while it is equipped.<br><br>
			It may not be as convenient as the BGII component but two clicks (about five seconds) definitely beats saving, closing your game, and editing your animation type in NI/Dalekeeper each time you equip a different type of armour.<br>
		</p><br>

		<hr style="width: 90%"><br>

		<h4>1ppv4: IWDII Avatar Switching</h4><br>

		<p>
			<strong>This is an IWDII port of the avatar switching component.</strong><br><br>

			IWDII's engine supports spells linked to items, so this component is about half-way between the BGII and IWD components.<br><br>
			Items change appearance automatically upon equipping, but due to lack of a persistent script will not change you back to your unarmoured state when you unequip (so if you equip robes on a fighter and unequip them, you'd be stuck with the unarmoured mage animation). <br><br>
			For you to be able to switch back, this adds an innate ability, working exactly like the ones in the IWD install. Exactly as in the IWD component as well, you don't have to use this if you switch from one armour to another.<br>
